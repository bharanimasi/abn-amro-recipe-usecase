Design Principles:

As part of implementation below design principles are considered

1. Single Responsibility Principle :
      As the name suggests, this principle states that each class should have one responsibility, one single purpose. This means that a class will do only one job, which leads us to conclude it should have only one reason to change . According this class created purse their own responsibilites as controller, service , mappers, converters so on. The classes created for implememtation will adhere to one functionality. Their methods and data will be concerned with one clear purpose. This means high cohesion, as well as robustness, which together reduce errors.
